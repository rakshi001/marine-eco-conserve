# üåç Marine Conservation AI

**Marine Conservation AI** is an advanced machine learning-powered application designed to support ocean conservation efforts. It leverages state-of-the-art image recognition and data analytics to detect plastic waste, monitor coral reef health, and predict harmful algal blooms (HABs). This tool aims to empower researchers, environmentalists, and conservationists in their mission to protect marine ecosystems.

## üöÄ Features

### 1. Plastic Waste Detection
- Identifies various categories of plastic waste in marine environments using image classification.
- Supports detection of:
  - Plastic Bottle
  - Plastic Bag
  - Plastic Container
  - Plastic Wrapper
  - Plastic Packaging
  - Other Plastic Waste
- Provides confidence scores for detected categories.

### 2. Coral Reef Health Monitoring (Planned Feature)
- Analyzes the health of coral reefs based on image data.
- Detects health statuses (e.g., healthy, stressed, or bleached coral).

### 3. Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) Prediction
- Utilizes environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, salinity, pH) to predict the likelihood of HAB occurrences.
- Employs a trained Random Forest Regressor for robust predictions.
